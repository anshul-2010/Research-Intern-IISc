I worked on the problem statement titled "Domain Adaptation for precise segmentation of medical organs" in the BioMedIA Laboratory of the Computational and Data Sciences Department, under Dr. Vaanathi Sundaresan. I developed a domain adaptation framework for segmenting abdominal organs in CT scans from different domains. 

Thereby, I implemented UNet-3D models with diverse augmentation techniques to enhance model robustness to domain shift. Moving ahead, I investigated synergistic image and feature adaptation for further adaptation with dice scores exceeding 0.8 for all organs. I implemented diverse augmentation techniques to effectively address domain shifts and enhance model robustness.

I also investigated Image Translation and Domain Invariant networks to further mitigate domain disparities. I also explored test-time adaptation to boost the model and address domain specific challenges effectively.
